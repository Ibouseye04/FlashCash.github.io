    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Attribution:</strong> Advertisers don't know how effective their television ads are because consumers are just searching on their phone for products they see on TV.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Purchasing:</strong> There is enormous friction in dialing a phone number, waiting on hold, speaking to a rep, & finalizing an order with your credit card number.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Call Center Costs:</strong> Call centers cut into margins and make for a less-than-ideal consumer experience. Money is left on the table for those watching on delay via DVR.
